IT'S THE END of the day, yet here I am trying to prove to myself once and for all that I can commit to something I have started: daily writing. I like to rise early, which means starting the day off with a cold shower at 5:20 a.m in the morning (I would get up even earlier in the summer). Not just for enjoyment, however, as I need to catch the right bus or else I would arrive at school late. To me, Monday means something different, as I get to wear another kind of uniform to school, one with a collar shirt and trousers, unlike every other day where I am seen with the sports uniform (we're only supposed to be using this uniform once a week; despite this, I did the opposite). Throughout the day, nothing prominent occurred other than the Physics test we got. I did well, and my two weeks of preparations were worthwhile. I read a lot of news to get to write better. Should I attempt to use ChatGPT next time to determine what I write? The [WIRED post](https://www.wired.com/story/i-asked-an-algorithm-to-optimize-my-life/) about AI determining an author's day got me excited!

Now, it is 10:00 p.m as I'm writing these few last sentences. I should really turn in (haven't gotten much sleep these days) and start planning for my next few months. Firstly, there are two big exams coming up at the end of March and beginning of July. I also pondered about the sciences competitions I could join in and internships while I'm still here in Vietnam. Lastly, for the past few days, I have been fixated on fixing my blog as well as setting up a mailing box for contact in case you, my dear reader, want to reach out.

Love,

Thuc
