# Past, Present, Yesterday

I took the SAT, finally and for the first time, tho I have not gotten a sound sleep for the past two days eventhough I promised to one that I would. Constantly waking up at 4:30 in the morning, just like what I did on the 3rd of December. I felt that I did well, however. But the anxiety started to kick in today, a day after my D-day. Is it the aftermath? Have I truly done well? I don’t know. My next 2 weeks will probably be longer than all of the past fortnights.

In the back of my mind, there are lingering thoughts that deject me. It makes me recall the initial experience with the scholastic test I had 2 years ago:

It was an ordinary afternoon at school, I was distracted from the last class, eagerly waiting to leave, take the bus, and head home. While staring unconsciously into my textbook, I notice one of my friends was bringing out a printed-out test, in English, and there was even Mathematics in it. Intrigued, I look into what it was, dismissing the in-class work I needed to do.

><span classname="reader">“What is this called, Khoi?”, I asked, and without waiting for him to respond, followed up with the use of such test.</span>

><span classname="author">“That’s the SAT, I'm learning it tho, but still a noob at it”, he replied.</span>

I was surprised by the number of words in it because I haven’t read many books before to fully be comfortable looking at lots of texts. A little discouraged, but I inquired to work on some of the questions, thinking that my knowledge from my old Honors English class would help me out. It didn’t.

I fumbled my way through the literature passage, rereading a sentence more than twice. “Oh, that word looks familiar” – that thought occurred to me multiple, if not many, times. Then I looked at the question stems. I was clueless. I wrote 8 questions, turned in the paper, and asked to be checked: I got 2 out of 8 right.

My firsthand experience with the SAT was not fun; however, it gave me the push to learn more about it after that day. The learning didn’t last long, unfortunately. Mathematics, the subject I hold a passion for, was turning against me. From the simplest converting units to reading worded problems gave me trouble. And for the reading, I was gaining some knowledge from reading one of the recommended prep books. Despite this, the increments was so minuscule that it is deterring as well.

At the end of my freshman year in high school, I started to get into programming, and that’s another story for a different time. To this day I still partially regret falling in love with it. For one, I could have honed my skills in learning the SAT and doing the test more, to have more confidence and more room to make errors on real test day, unlike now, when I only have one and only one chance of taking the test. On the contrary, I would not have known what to pursue in my higher education without programming, as I think it has been my greatest motivation for doing many things.

Yesterday, when leaving the test centre, I feel exhausted. But, I feel like I have done my best, and I don’t regret anything. A part of me is reacting to it: anxiety, apprehension, the foreshadowing. I hope everything would be good and I’m prepared. This journey is unique to me and I am proud of myself.
