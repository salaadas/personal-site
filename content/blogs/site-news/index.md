TODAY WAS GREAT, we had a fun time at school when preparing for the celebration of the 8th of March for all the other girls. In this blog, I want to share that I will work own another framework for this blog as Gatsby proove to me that it is unscalable. I came to this revelation at around last year, after an even longer break compare to the last time. All the packages are outdated, and if I were to update them, they break. Which is tantalizing knowing how much my project is being dependent on some other softwares.

As such, I will make my own framework. I don't know where to start with yet. So in the mean while I will keep using this site to post my blogs and will migrate eventually to another one. I'm all ears for any pointers, so feel free to reach out to my work mail at ***thuctd.tran@gmail.com***

Or, another solution would be to fix the problems that were encoded by other authors, which doesn't sound like fun. Truth be told, making one from the ground up is by no means all sunshine and rainbows but at least I would learn a lot from it.

I'm motivated, and in search for some sample ones. There is the [Xesite](https://github.com/Xe/site), [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) that I could take inspirations from. Goodluck to me!

See you next time,

Thuc

*P/s: Next.js is also another big player in the SSG verse. The thing is, it is too huge for me to handle. So I will look into it last, after having no success with the rest.*
